## Overview

#

GameTerest allows users to view and comment on anticpated videogames. Users will be shown a list of games in which they can like, add to their profile, and leave comments/reviews. Users will have to sign up in order to interact with the videogames, but guests can view games and read comments.

## GitHub Project Board

The link below is a list of our MVP's and post-MVP's. Each person will be assigned set of tasks that are posted on the to-do list. Once they start working on this task, they will bring it to the to do half. After they have completed their assignment, they will put it in the done board. Additional tasks may be added as we continue this ambition, but we will consult with each other who would be okay with getting the new task.
